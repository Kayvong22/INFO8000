# INFO8000KG Final Project
 
"FinalProjectPart1" and "FinalProjectPart2" are the codes for the final project.

"FinalProjectPart1" has retrieval of data from Google forms, using Google Drive API, and visualizations of frequency response for certain sensors as well as distibution of frequencies for each sensor.

"FinalProjectPart2" contains lstm training and I could not figure out what was wrong with it, but I did not get an accuracy above 0.36
